	This is an application developed on Google App Engine build by a 5 member team(including me) using Google Appengine(webapp2) in  
	geeklist hackathon(48 hours) scheduled at Google-Hyderabad.
	This application takes in the complaints that a user has regarding to various categories(categories are limited  
	for the time being, we will add the rest). He can see other people complaints, like them and follow them.  
	He can filter   the complaints based on categories, and locations.  
	Please reply back if you find any error prone feature or any lacking feature.  
	Comply with the app since it was made within 2 days only.  
	I hope you visit test-ak5.appspot.com to try the app.  
	P.S. The app is responsive and will work on mobiles and tablets also. Enjoy
